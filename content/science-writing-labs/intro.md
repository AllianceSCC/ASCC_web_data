Process-oriented and strengths-focused professional development programs for early writers and peer reviewers. 

  **One-on-One** Labs, which focus on the writing skills and techniques of ONE trainee. While [editorial services]({{< ref "writing_services/" >}}) focus on the details of a single document and what can be done to improve _it_. A one-on-one Science Writing Lab focuses on YOU and developing your writing skills such as methods for tackling a new writing project or revisions. The writing project that you provide helps target the professional development to meet your needs and gives you an opportunity to practice what you learn.

  **Peer Feedback** Labs are groups of _three_ trainees that work together with a single facilitator. These labs focus on the type of feedback that should be provided during each stage of writing, and participants recieve feedback on their feedback from the facilitator.
