  <details><summary><b>What's the difference between the "one-on-one" and "peer feedback" labs?</b></summary>
  
  **One-on-One** Labs focus on the writing skills and techniques of ONE trainee.
  
  **Peer Feedback** Labs are groups of _three_ trainees that work together with a single facilitator. These labs focus on the type of feedback necessary during each stage of writing and participants recieve feedback on their feedback from the facilitator.
