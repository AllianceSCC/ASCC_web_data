* "How to Write a Review Paper" --- A one hour webinar to break down the intimidating project of a review paper into manageable pieces. Participants will learn tools to facilitate their writing process and to revise a first draft for their advisor.

* "Telling Your Science as a Story" --- A two hour workshop to learn the basics of adapting narrative storytelling to your scientific story. By the end, participants will have learned the And/But/Therefore (ABT) narrative structure and identified the most compelling story line for their science.
