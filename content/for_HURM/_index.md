To help _make science accessible_, Alliance SciComm & Consulting dedicates upto 10% of the work week to providing pro bono editing services through the [Academic Editing Circle](https://academic-editing-circle.us/), "a group of professional editors who have organized to make editing services easily available to Black and/or Indigenous people building academic careers."

To access free editing services, you can review their list of [available pro bono editors](https://academic-editing-circle.us/find-editors/) or [contact us]({{< ref "../#contact" >}}). Be sure to include (i) the type of project youâ€™re working on (journal article, book chapter, dissertation, funding proposal), (ii) the type of help you're looking for (developmental editing, line editing, proofing), and (iii) your general timeline (especially if you have a fixed external deadline) in your email.
