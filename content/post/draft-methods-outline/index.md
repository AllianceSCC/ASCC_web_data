The writing process consists of several steps: prewriting, drafting, revising, editing, and publication. The [outline]({{< relref "post/why_outline" >}}) is generated during the prewriting stage and, while necessary to describe the broad structure of an article, it is rarely revisited. 

>The outline drafting method, however, expands on the original outline to structure the drafting process. 

Beginning with the original outlining of the topic, major supporting topics, and key points, this drafting process gradually increases the level of detail for each section. This continues until every potential paragraph has been outlined to the appropriate degree of detail. All appropriate definitions, explanations, descriptions, evidence, or examples should be included along with any quotes that might be incorporated within the text.

>**Introduction**
  - The writing process 
  - Prewriting
    - Outline
    - rarely revisited 
  - This method expands the outline 
  
>**Description**
  - Increase the detail
  - outline each paragraph 
  - Including more than facts 
  - rewrite in full sentences 
  - add transitions 
  
>**Conclusion**
  - Helps with 
    - short bursts of writing 
    - writer's block 
  - almost exactly match the outline 
  - may require more transition revisions
  
***

When as much detail has been added as possible, each fragment of the detailed outline is rewritten as a full, and complete sentence. Given that each sentence and paragraph will be drafted in isolation, the essential final step in the outline drafting method is to add the appropriate transitions between paragraphs and statements.

The outline drafting method is particularly helpful for those who can only work for short bursts and/or have severe writer's block. The complete first draft should follow the beginning outline (that you and your advisor agreed on) almost exactly, though it may require more transition revisions than if it were written using other drafting methods.
