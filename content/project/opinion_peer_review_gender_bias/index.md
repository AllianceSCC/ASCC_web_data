title: "Opinion: Peer Review Study Compromises Response to Gender Bias"
summary: "A massive project analyzing the peer-review outcomes of 350,000 manuscripts from 145 journals found no evidence of gender bias following manuscript submission. I published a similar, though smaller-scale, study that analyzed the peer-review outcomes from 108,000 manuscript submissions to 13 ASM journals. Both projects analyzed six yearsâ€™ worth of submission data but came to different conclusions."
