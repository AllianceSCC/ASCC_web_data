title: "4 Tips for Identifying an Employers Work Life Balance"
summary: "In any career transition, it’s important to keep in mind the work-life balance that you will (or won’t) have with your potential employer. In addition to your home life, work-life balance is associated with stress levels and the quality of the relationship that you have with your boss. While some work-life factors are self-determined and can be changed during the quest for it, many are directly influenced by workplace culture and policies."
